# Mars Rover
The surface of Mars is represented by a Plateau, which is a square/rectangular grid.
Rovers on the surface of Mars navigate the Plateau by following a sequence of commands.

# Features

- each rover has a starting position of (x, y) coordinates and a direction, which is North, South, West or East
- the rover can turn left or right and move forward depending on its commands
